Deep Learning:
	I had to redo the projects in order to get them to work.  After editing different project and solution settings to no avail, I started fresh and followed more thoroughly all the instructions given in the assignment.  In writing the test code, I had to try different initial values for the vectors to get a result that showed that the function that I was testing was working.
